# ML-Project-Crop-Recommendation
# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts the best crop using inputs like:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - pH
  - Rainfall (mm)
- Machine learning model trained on real agricultural data
- Web interface built using Flask
- Scalable and easily extendable for future improvements

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model is trained on a crop recommendation dataset with labeled data containing soil and weather features along with the recommended crop.

- Features:
  - `N`, `P`, `K`: soil nutrients
  - `temperature`: in Celsius
  - `humidity`: in percentage
  - `ph`: acidity/alkalinity of the soil
  - `rainfall`: in mm

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning

- Algorithms used: `RandomForestClassifier` (best-performing model)
- Preprocessing:
  - `MinMaxScaler` for normalization
  - `StandardScaler` for standardization
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy Score

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web app)
- HTML(for frontend)
